        "context": "Fibromyalgia is the second most common condition affecting your bones and muscles. Yet it's often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Its classic symptoms are widespread muscle and joint pain and fatigue. There's no cure. But a combination of medication, exercise, managing your stress, and healthy habits may ease your symptoms enough that you can live a normal, active life. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but some think it's a problem with how your brain and spinal cord process pain signals from your nerves. We do know certain things suggest you're more likely to get it: You're a woman. You have another painful disease, such as arthritis, or an infection. You have a mood disorder, like anxiety or depression. You were physically or emotionally abused or have PTSD. You rarely exercise. Other family members have it. Simply put, you ache all over. Common symptoms include: Muscle pain, burning, twitching, or tightness Low pain threshold or tender points Draining fatigue Trouble concentrating and remembering, called \"fibro fog\" Insomnia or not sleeping well Feeling nervous, worried, or depressed Fibromyalgia can feel similar to osteoarthritis, bursitis, and tendinitis. But rather than hurting in a specific area, the pain and stiffness could be throughout your body. Other fibro symptoms can include: Belly pain, bloating, queasiness, constipation, and diarrhea (irritable bowel syndrome) Headaches Dry mouth, nose, and eyes Sensitivity to cold, heat, light, or sound Peeing more often Numbness or tingling in your face, arms, hands, legs, or feet Your doctor will examine you and ask you about your past medical issues and about other close family members. There's no test that can tell you that you have fibromyalgia. Instead, because the symptoms are so similar to other conditions, your doctor will want to rule out illnesses such as an underactive thyroid, different types of arthritis, and lupus. So you may get blood tests to check hormone levels and signs of inflammation, as well as X-rays. If your doctor can't find another reason for how you feel, they'll use a two-part scoring system to measure how widespread your pain has been and how much your symptoms affect your daily life. Using those results, together you'll come up with a plan to manage the condition. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and drugs that help you sleep. The three drugs approved specifically for fibro pain are: Duloxetine ( Cymbalta) Milnacipran ( Savella) Pregabalin ( Lyrica) Over-the-counter painkillers may help, too. Stronger medicines, like opioids, tend not to work well in the long run, and you could become dependent on them. Regular moderate exercise is key to controlling fibro. You'll want to do low-impact activities that build your endurance, stretch and strengthen your muscles, and improve your ability to move easily -- like yoga, tai chi, Pilates, and even walking. Exercise also releases endorphins, which fight pain, stress, and feeling down. And it can help you sleep better. You can try complementary therapies, including massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic manipulation, to ease aches and stress, too. A counselor, therapist, or support group may help you deal with difficult emotions and how to explain to others what's going on with you."

        "context": "A tremor is when a body part moves or shakes and you can't control it. Many people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) have some form of tremor they can't control, in different parts of their bodies, like their head, arms, or legs. Intention tremor. There's no shaking when you're at rest. It starts when you try to reach or grasp something or move your hand or foot to a precise spot. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Postural tremors. You shake when you sit or stand, but not when you lie down. Resting tremor. You move more when you're sitting still and less when you move. This is more common with Parkinson's disease than MS. Nystagmus. This type causes jumpy eye movements. This disease damages the protective sheath (myelin) that covers the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. Tremors result from damage to a part of your brain called the cerebellum. It controls your balance and coordination and smooths out the actions that you make when you move your limbs and eyes or speak. These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. There aren't any drugs made just to treat MS tremors. Your doctors will probably prescribe drugs for another condition, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement. A brace on your ankle or foot can make it easier to walk. They can help control your arm, hand, or neck, too. Deep brain stimulation: This experimental approach is mostly used for people who have tremors from Parkinson's disease. A doctor implants electrodes into your brain. Wires connect them to a gadget in your chest. You use it to send your brain signals that stop the tremors. Medical cannabis: There's little evidence that cannabis can help with tremors, but study results are mixed and usually only include small numbers of people. Physical therapy: It can show you exercises that increase your range of motion, improve your posture and balance, and make your body more stable Speech therapy: If you have tremors in your lips, tongue, or jaw, a health professional can work with you to slow your speech, make it clearer, and control the volume. Occupational therapist: This person will set you up with special tools called adaptive or assistive devices. They can help you grab things from up high or off the floor, pull up a zipper, or hold a fork more easily. Weights: Adding extra weight to a body part can help keep it still. You can also add weights to commonly used items like forks, pencils, pens, eating utensils, canes, and walkers. Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. You may feel like you want to be alone, but that can make you feel lonely and depressed. A psychologist or counselor can help you find ways to feel more comfortable in public and keep the tremors from changing how you live your life."

        "context": "Could diet be to blame for your child's eczema? It's possible. Up to 1 in 3 kids with eczema has a food allergy that could make symptoms worse. If you remove some choices, it could make a big difference. But since finding food triggers is tricky -- and eczema can have lots of other causes -- don't jump to conclusions. Work closely with an allergist. When you have a food allergy, your body reacts to a harmless treat as if it's a dangerous germ and attacks. Symptoms -- like swelling -- are side effects of your body's defenses. Eczema doesn't seem to be an allergic condition, but reactions from food can make it worse in some kids. It's more likely in babies and young children. Some foods are more likely to bring symptoms. The common offenders are: Milk Eggs Peanuts Tree nuts Wheat Fish Shellfish Soy While trigger foods can make eczema worse, experts don't think they're really the original cause. Instead, it seems to result from \"leakiness\" in the outer layer of skin that lets in irritants, germs, and allergens. Some are obvious. If your child eats lobster for the first time and breaks out in hives 15 minutes later, it's probably not hard to figure out. But with eczema, it's often tougher. Symptoms may not show up for days after you eat something. If you do find a trigger food and get rid of it, that may help. Still, it may not make the eczema go away. Remember, 2 out of 3 kids with eczema don't have a food allergy at all. That's why working with a doctor is so important. He can guide you toward the real cause through tests like: Elimination diets. If your doctor thinks a food may be harmful, he may ask you not to give it to your kid for 10 to 14 days. Watch to see if it makes a difference. Food challenges. After you've taken a food out of your child's diet, your pediatrician might want you to add a small amount back in to see if it causes symptoms. He may want to do this in the office, just in case your child has a reaction. Skin testing. A doctor can take an extract of the food and use it to scratch the skin lightly. If the area swells up, that could be an allergic reaction. However, it's not always accurate. Blood tests. RAST -- a radioallergosorbent test -- can check for special cells in the blood that signal specific food allergies. Again, it's not always accurate. Other lab tests can check for cells that trigger swelling. Tracking down a food trigger can take patience and detective work. Be methodical. Only eliminate one food at a time. If you ban dairy and gluten at the same time and symptoms get better, you won't know which one made the difference. Use a food diary to keep track of what you get rid of, and the changes that brings. Move slowly. A positive skin test isn't reason enough to cut out a food. Lots of kids test positive for foods that don't really cause symptoms. Plus, if you get rid of too many foods, you could cut out nutrients your child needs to grow and develop. So for his sake and yours, be sure before you take a food from your child's diet permanently. Work with your doctor. Keep using other treatments. Even if you find a trigger food, getting rid of it may not make the rash disappear. Stick with the other things your doctor recommends -- like skin ointments, lotions, and medicines. Continue to steer clear other allergens like dust mites, pollen, or pet dander, too."

        "context": "When a parent, partner, or someone else you love gets diagnosed with dementia, you want to do everything possible to help them, including their memory, thinking skills, mood, and behavior. It's a lot to take in. But there are steps that can help. These include working with their doctor to treat their dementia symptoms and any other conditions they may have. There are also other kinds of therapies that may help with their daily life. And everyday habits also matter, such as exercise, good nutrition, staying social, doing things that challenge their mind, and getting good sleep. No medication can cure dementia. But some may help with some of the symptoms for a time. And doctors may prescribe other meds to treat problems brought on by dementia, such as depression, trouble sleeping, or irritability. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil ( Aricept), galantamine ( Razadyne), and rivastigmine ( Exelon) slow the breakdown of a brain chemical involved in memory and judgment. Memantine ( Namenda) helps control a different brain chemical needed for learning and memory. Sometimes doctors prescribe memantine along with donepezil in a combination drug ( Namzaric) for moderate to severe dementia. Antidepressants , especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs), can improve low mood and irritability. Anxiolytics such as lorazepam ( Ativan) or oxazepam ( Serax) can ease anxiety or restlessness. Antipsychotic medicines such as aripiprazole ( Abilify), haloperidol ( Haldol), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), and risperidone ( Risperdal) can help control feelings and behaviors such as aggression, agitation, delusions, or hallucinations. These approaches might help jog your loved one's memory and thinking skills -- or at least give them pleasure and brighten their day. Make sure anything they try helps their quality of life and doesn't make them feel frustrated or overwhelmed. Reminiscence therapy might include things like talking with your loved one about their hometown, school days, work life, or favorite hobbies. It can be done one-on-one or in groups as part of an organized therapy. The person leading the session might use music from your loved one's past, or things like photos or treasured items, to help. Cognitive stimulation therapy ( CST) is a structured program for groups of people with mild to moderate dementia. At meetings, the group does mentally engaging activities, like talking about current events, singing, playing word games, or cooking from a recipe. Reality orientation training goes over basic things like the person's name, and the date and time. They might have signs with that information placed around their home. Some people find this to be too much or even patronizing. If it's not working for your loved one, drop it. Even when someone has dementia, their daily habits can affect how they feel. The same things that are good for their heart and the rest of their body are also going to help their mind -- and their mood. Stay active. Whether it's a fitness class for seniors or other physical activity such as walking, dancing, and gardening, it counts. Of course, you'll want to make sure their workouts are safe for them to do, and their abilities might be different depending on whether they are in the early, middle, or later stages of dementia (and what other conditions they may have). Research shows that exercise may slow down dementia symptoms such as thinking problems, and ease anxiety or depression. Prioritize good sleep. For many people with dementia, symptoms can be worse later in the day. So encourage a calm routine. It helps for your loved one to avoid caffeinated tea and coffee, especially in the evening, and to limit daytime naps. Keep the end of the day quiet, without a blaring TV. Focus on foods. What your loved one eats will affect their health, including their brain. Good habits may even have the power to slow dementia. You may have heard of the MIND diet. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet (which seeks to lower high blood pressure). It's being studied as a way to cut the chance of getting dementia. More research is being done to check on that, and whether it curbs dementia that's already started. But in general, it's a healthy way of eating that's in line with communities where dementia tends to be rare. Researchers say the MIND diet includes: Vegetables, especially leafy greens (think of spinach, kale, and other greens) Nuts Berries Beans Whole grains Fish Poultry Olive oil Wine The plan limits red meat, butter and stick margarine, cheese, sweets, and fried foods. Keep in mind that eating isn't just about nutrients and calories. It's also social and personal, and a source of enjoyment. If your loved one is able to cook, let them join in. And make sure they are involved in what they eat. Challenge the brain. This doesn't have to include doing crossword puzzles or sudoku, unless your loved one enjoys those things and can still do them without getting frustrated. Instead, it might mean revisiting a hobby that person has always loved and is still able to do, like enjoying music, playing the piano, or going to services if they had a longtime place of worship. If these things help them stay social, that's even better. Stay organized. Keep a calendar and other easy-to-see reminders around their home to help remember upcoming events and plans. Rethink the home. You may want to remove items that create clutter and noise (such as extra TVs or radios) and hide things that can be dangerous, such as knives or car keys. Seeing and hearing properly are especially important for someone with dementia. Trouble seeing can make it harder to recognize familiar people or things. Vision or hearing problems can also make dementia symptoms like confusion worse as well as make your loved one feel more alone. Schedule a vision checkup with your loved one's eye doctor to see if they need a new eyeglass prescription. Also, ask their primary doctor to refer you to a doctor who can do a hearing test to give them a new hearing aid, if needed. A dementia diagnosis is stressful. If your loved one needs help coming to terms with it, ask the doctor treating their dementia to refer you to a trained mental health professional. ( You might also want to do this for yourself, if you'd like help adjusting to their condition.) This might include an individual or family therapist, social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist. Joining a local or online support group for people with dementia can also be comforting. At your loved one's first visit with a counselor, they'll talk about their symptoms (emotional, mental, and physical) and why they want counseling. You might take a survey with these questions. Your answers will give the counselor a better idea of the best ways to help."

        "context": "Lately you've been feeling a little -- to put it delicately -- backed up. You're not \"going\" as often as you should, and you feel bloated and uncomfortable. Don't be embarrassed. A lot of Americans -- more than 4 million by some estimates -- deal with constipation on a regular basis. Women are the most frequent constipation sufferers. This may have to do with the slower movement of food through a woman's intestines, as well as with the effects of female hormones on the GI tract. So what do you do when you just can't go? Here are a few effective constipation treatments. If you're constipated, it's often because there isn't enough water in your stool, a problem that occurs when you don't drink enough fluids. According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, part of the National Institutes of Health, constipation is a condition in which you have fewer than three bowel movements in a week, and your stools are hard, dry, and small, making them painful and difficult to pass. Some women naturally have a bowel movement a few times a day, while others go just a few times a week. You don't need constipation treatments unless you're going to the bathroom a lot less often than usual. One way to keep things moving is by getting enough fiber in your diet, which makes stool bulkier and softer so it's easier to pass. Gradually increase the amount of fiber in your diet until you're getting at least 20 to 35 grams of fiber daily. Good fiber sources include: Bran and other whole grains found in cereals, breads, and brown rice Vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, carrots, and asparagus Fresh fruits, or dried fruits such as raisins, apricots, and prunes Beans While you're having an issue with constipation, limit foods that are high in fat and low in fiber, like cheese and other dairy products, processed foods, and meat. They can make constipation worse. And on the subject of diet, water is important for preventing constipation, too. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Also, exercise regularly. Moving your body will keep your bowels moving, too. A box of laxatives shouldn't be the first place you turn to relieve constipation. Reserve laxatives for constipation that doesn't improve after you've added fiber and water to your diet. See your doctor for long-term constipation, because a medicine you're taking or a medical condition could be the cause. In that case, stopping the medicine or treating the problem should relieve your constipation. If your doctor recommends laxatives, ask what type is best for you, and for how long you should take them. Laxatives are best taken short-term only, because you don't want to start relying on them to go to the bathroom. Also ask how to ease off laxatives when you no longer need them. Stopping them too abruptly can affect your colon's ability to contract. Laxatives come in several forms: Bulk-forming fiber supplements include Citrucel, Fiber Con, and Metamucil. Unlike other laxatives, you can take these every day. They make the stool bigger and softer. Although they are safe to use regularly, fiber supplements can interfere with your body's ability to absorb certain medicines, and they may cause bloating, cramps, and gas. Drink a lot of water with them. Lubricant laxatives, including Zymenol, help the stool pass more easily through the colon. In general, doctors do not recommend using mineral oil or castor oil. Mineral oil can cause problems such as vitamin deficiencies, and castor oil can lead to long-term constipation. Osmotic laxatives such as lactulose, Miralax, Milk of Magnesia, and Sorbitol help fluids move through your intestines. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor before taking osmotics because they can cause electrolyte imbalances. Stimulant laxatives such as Dulcolax and Senokot make the muscles in your intestines contract to help push stool out. These laxatives work quickly, but they can cause side effects, including cramping and diarrhea, so use them for as short a period of time as possible. Stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak make stools easier to pass by adding fluid to them. Having softer stool can prevent you from having to strain during bowel movements. Your doctor may recommend one of these products if your constipation is due to childbirth or surgery. Prescription medications such as lubiprostone ( Amitiza) and linaclotide ( Linzess) work by drawing water into your intestines and speeding up the movement of stool. Plecanitide ( Trulance) changes stool consistency by increasing the amount of water into the GI lumen and increases gastrointestinal movement. Note that Amitiza is approved for use only in women. Regardless of what constipation treatment you use, give yourself enough time to sit on the toilet when you need to go. Holding in the urge can make your constipation worse. Set aside a regular time of the day when you know you'll be left undisturbed for several minutes. Also, don't ignore the problem. Untreated constipation can lead to real problems, such as hemorrhoids and tears in the skin around the anus (called fissures) that make you bleed. If you strain too hard, you might even cause part of your intestines to push out through the anus -- a condition called rectal prolapse that can sometimes require surgery. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms with constipation: Stomach pain Blood in your stools Unexplained weight loss Inability to have a bowel movement Also, call if you've been having trouble going for more than three weeks and constipation treatments aren't working. You may have a condition called Chronic Idiopathic Constipation ( CIC) which means your constipation may be caused by something other than physical or physiological."

        "context": "You can do many things to help knee pain, whether it's due to a recent injury or arthritis you've had for years. Follow these 11 dos and don'ts to help your knees feel their best. Don't rest too much. Too much rest can weaken your muscles, which can worsen joint pain. Find an exercise program that is safe for your knees and stick with it. If you're not sure which motions are safe or how much you can do, talk with your doctor or a physical therapist. Do exercise. Cardio exercises strengthen the muscles that support your knee and increase flexibility. Weight training and stretching do, too. For cardio, some good choices include walking, swimming, water aerobics, stationary cycling, and elliptical machines. Tai chi may also help ease stiffness and improve balance. Don't risk a fall. A painful or unstable knee can make a fall more likely, which can cause more knee damage. Curb your risk of falling by making sure your home is well lit, using handrails on staircases, and using a sturdy ladder or foot stool if you need to reach something from a high shelf. Do use \" RICE.\" Rest, ice, compression, and elevation ( RICE) is good for knee pain caused by a minor injury or an arthritis flare. Give your knee some rest, apply ice to reduce swelling, wear a compressive bandage, and keep your knee elevated. Don't overlook your weight. If you're overweight, losing weight reduces the stress on your knee. You don't even need to get to your \"ideal\" weight. Smaller changes still make a difference. Don't be shy about using a walking aid. A crutch or cane can take the stress off of your knee. Knee splints and braces can also help you stay stable. Do consider acupuncture. This form of traditional Chinese medicine, which involves inserting fine needles at certain points on the body, is widely used to relieve many types of pain and may help knee pain. Don't let your shoes make matters worse. Cushioned insoles can reduce stress on your knees. For knee osteoarthritis, doctors often recommend special insoles that you put in your shoe. To find the appropriate insole, speak with your doctor or a physical therapist. Do play with temperature. For the first 48 to 72 hours after a knee injury, use a cold pack to ease swelling and numb the pain. A plastic bag of ice or frozen peas works well. Use it for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day. Wrap your ice pack in a towel to be kind to your skin. After that, you can heat things up with a warm bath, heating pad, or warm towel for 15 to 20 minutes, three or four times a day. Don't jar your joint(s). High-impact exercises can further injure painful knees. Avoid jarring exercises such as running, jumping, and kickboxing. Also avoid doing exercises such as lunges and deep squats that put a lot of stress on your knees. These can worsen pain and, if not done correctly, cause injury. Do get expert advice. If your knee pain is new, get a doctor to check it out. It's best to know what you're dealing with ASAP so you can prevent any more damage."

        "context": "If you have migraines, you know these throbbing, pulsing headaches can put a damper on an otherwise good day. While medications can help you manage them, there can be side effects. That's why some people with migraines like to go \u00e2\u0080\u009call natural\u00e2\u0080\u009d to find relief. The good news is there is some evidence these supplements, which include things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, may help. But the science is limited. Remember, \u00e2\u0080\u009call natural\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor. It's important to note that the FDA doesn't have the authority to review these kinds of products for safety and effectiveness before they're put on the market. So your best bet may be to look for a \u00e2\u0080\u009c USP Verified\u00e2\u0080\u009d label. That means it's at least been tested by the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention for things like purity and potency. It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you. Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics. Better known as vitamin B2, this may make migraines less frequent and less severe for some people. It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills. Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression. If you take an anticoagulant, an immunosuppressant, diabetes medications, or birth control pills, talk to your doctor since it can interact with these drugs."

        "context": "Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM) is when the heart's ability to pump blood is lessened because its main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, is enlarged and weakened. In some cases, this prevents the heart from filling with blood as it should. Over time, it can affect the other chambers. Many people with dilated cardiomyopathy have no symptoms. Some that do have only minor ones, and live a normal life. Others develop symptoms that may get worse as their heart gets sicker. Symptoms of DCM can happen at any age and may include: Shortness of breath Swelling of your legs Fatigue Weight gain Fainting Palpitations (fluttering in the chest due to abnormal heart rhythms) Dizziness or lightheadedness Blood clots in the dilated left ventricle because of pooling of the blood. If a blood clot breaks off, it can lodge in an artery and disrupt blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. A clot can also block blood flow to the organs in the abdomen or legs. Chest pain or pressure Sudden death DCM can be inherited, but it's usually caused by other things, including: Severe coronary artery disease Alcoholism Thyroid disease Diabetes Viral infections of the heart Heart valve abnormalities Drugs that damage the heart It can also happen in women after they give birth. That's called postpartum cardiomyopathy. Your doctor will decide if you have DCM after he looks at things like: Your symptoms Your family history A physical exam Blood tests An electrocardiogram A chest X-ray An echocardiogram An exercise stress test Cardiac catheterization A CT scan An MRI Another test that's rarely done to find the cause of cardiomyopathy is called a myocardial biopsy, or heart biopsy. A tissue sample is taken from the heart and examined under a microscope. If you have a relative with dilated cardiomyopathy, ask your doctor if you should be screened for it. Genetic testing may also be available to find abnormal genes. In the case of dilated cardiomyopathy, it's aimed at making the heart stronger and getting rid of substances in the bloodstream that enlarge the heart and lead to more severe symptoms: Medications: To manage heart failure, most people take drugs, such as a: Beta blocker ACE inhibitor or an ARB Diuretic If you have an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), your doctor may give you medicine to control your heart rate or make them happen less often. Blood thinners may also be used to prevent blood clots. Lifestyle changes: If you have heart failure, you should have less sodium, based on your doctor's recommendations. He may point you toward aerobic exercise, but don't do heavy weightlifting. People with severe DCM may need one of the following surgeries: Cardiac resynchronization by biventricular pacemaker: For some people with DCM, stimulating the right and left ventricles with this helps your heart's contractions get stronger. This improves your symptoms and lets you exercise more. The pacemaker also will help people with heart block (a problem with the heart's electrical system) or some bradycardias (slow heart rates). Implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICD): These are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It constantly monitors your heart's rhythm. When it finds a very fast, abnormal rhythm, it ''shocks'' the heart muscle back into a healthy beat. Surgery: Your doctor may recommend a surgery for coronary artery disease or valve disease. You may be eligible for one to fix your left ventricle or one that gives you a device to help your heart work better. Heart transplant: These are usually just for those with end-stage heart failure. You'll go through a selection process. Hearts that can be used are in short supply. Also, you must be both sick enough that you need a new heart, and healthy enough to have the procedure."

        "context": "Menopause doesn't cause you to gain weight. But because extra pounds can creep on as women age, a spare tire around the middle has often been dubbed the \"meno-pot\" or \"meno-pudge.\" Don't ditch your skinny jeans, though -- here's the truth about this \"middle-age spread\" and what you can do about it. Women tend to have more fat during middle age than men do. Even if you don't add pounds, you may find that clothes don't fit because the waist is too tight. What gives? Doctors think several things can work together to explain why weight gain can strike around this time: We burn fat more slowly as we age. All bodies slow down over time. Many women exercise less in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Busy lives and lapsed gym cards mean less muscle and more fat. Falling hormone levels, plus your genes, cause your body to store fat in new places after menopause. You may have once had more padding at the hips. Now there's more at the waist. This can shift your shape from pear-like (wider at hips and thighs) to apple-like (wider at waist and belly). What doesn't add pounds? Hormone levels. There's no proof that menopause hormone therapy can correct the weight gain. But regular exercise -- even something as simple as walking -- can help many symptoms of menopause. Whatever the cause, more menopausal women in the U. S. are overweight than at their normal weight. Those extra pounds come with added health concerns, too. Belly fat is linked to heart problems, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, and breast and colon cancer. Even when body mass index ( BMI -- a measure of body fat based on height and weight) is normal, a large waist (35 inches or more for women) along with other risks is linked to more chances of getting diabetes in women. Excess weight responds well to some effort. Here's what helps: Eat a bit less. Pounds gained now may be more likely to go right to your middle. Since your goal should be to lessen weight gain overall, eating just 200 fewer calories a day in your 50s can help. Eat healthier. Food choices make a big change. In astudy, women lost weightat menopause by eating a diet with more nutrients and fewer calories. They ditched sugary drinks, fried foods, meats, cheese, and desserts for fish, fruits, and vegetables. Maintain muscle. Regular exercise helps boost your metabolism and burns off what you eat, and helps your body shed fat faster overall. Keeping active adds muscle mass, which also helps prevent weight gain. Walking, jogging, and strength training also help you shed pounds. Manage your menopause symptoms. Hot flashes and poor sleep can raise your stress levels. Stress packs on pounds. Exercise can help. Ask your doctor what else might work for you."

        "context": "Weather can be tough on anyone's skin, especially if you have eczema. But which weather is worst? That depends on the person. Hot, cold, humid, and dry -- any type of weather can cause an eczema flare-up in some people. Find out how to prepare for your itchy weather -- and the ways that weather can trigger your symptoms. Healthy skin acts as a barrier to protect you -- the way a good coat of paint guards your house from the summer heat and winter snow. But when you have eczema, that barrier just doesn't work as well. It leaks moisture, so your skin can get dried out and gets more irritated by heat, cold, humidity, wind, and more. Weather also can affect your eczema indirectly. For example, a warm, windy day can blow pollen into the air and onto your skin. If you're allergic, that means an itchy flare-up. The weather can change your own behavior as well. If you're outside more in the warmer months and huddled under a blanket in the winter, you'll be exposed to different eczema triggers in different seasons. The key is to notice the types of weather that stir up your eczema -- and scratching. For some people with eczema, warm, sunny, and humid weather brings relief. Others find that the hot weather triggers prickly heat and a frenzy of scratching. To ease symptoms, try these tips: Don't get too sweaty. Sweating dries out your skin, and the salt in sweat can sting and irritate it. So try to stay cool. Take it easy on hot days and stick to indoor activities. Use air conditioning or a fan if you need one. Wear soft, breathable clothing. Keep your skin cool by staying away from nylon, wool, rough linen, or any fabric that's stiff or itchy. Generally, cotton is best. Know how the sun affects you. Sunlight can be a salve for eczema. In fact, people with severe cases can benefit from ultraviolet ray treatments. But others find that sunlight is a trigger. If you're one of them, shield yourself with clothes and a hat. Prepare before you swim. Chlorine in pools or the salt in seawater can be irritating for some people with eczema. Apply a layer of lotion before you dive in to see if it helps. Rinse off possible triggers. Take a quick, cool shower to soothe your skin and wash away sweat, chlorine, salt water, pollen, or other triggers. Gently pat yourself dry and apply lotion right away. Watch the sprays and lotions. Sunscreens and bug sprays can have chemicals that trigger symptoms. Opt for sunscreens that physically block the ultraviolet rays with the minerals zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Test a sample on your arm before you slather it all over your body. Winter air can be hard on your skin, drying it out and triggering an eczema flare-up. Here's what you can do: Keep showers tepid. It's especially hard in the winter, but you always need to use lukewarm water in the shower or bath. Hot water can trigger symptoms, especially if you're changing temperatures quickly -- like coming inside from shoveling snow and hopping into a hot bath. Moisturize! You should already be doing it daily -- ideally right after you bathe -- year round. But it's especially important when the weather is cold. Make sure you apply the lotion your doctor recommends on any body parts that might be exposed to cold air, like your face and hands. Think of lotion as an extra barrier you need to help lock in moisture and protect your skin. Guard against itchy clothes. Your cozy wool sweater can be an eczema trigger. If you do wear wool, use a cotton shirt underneath to cover your skin. Wear cotton gloves under your winter gloves or mittens. Don't overheat. When you're bundled up in a heavy coat, it's easy to break out in an itchy sweat. Wear layers, and take them off and put them on as needed to stay comfortable. Watch out for indoor allergens. If you're cooped up inside in winter weather, you may be surrounded by indoor allergens -- like pet dander, dust mites, and more. If allergies are a trigger for your eczema, take steps to control them. Keep pets out of your bedroom, put dust mite-proof covers on your mattress and pillows, remove carpeting, and wash sheets and blankets regularly. If you feel like you're losing the battle with Mother Nature over your weather-related symptoms, see your doctor or dermatologist. She can help you pinpoint the causes. She can also prescribe different or more powerful remedies, including corticosteroid creams and antihistamines."

        "context": "Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) mainly affects the joints. But it, and many of the medications that treat it, can also affect the skin. Do you recognize any of these problems? About 1 in 5 of people with rheumatoid arthritis get rheumatoid nodules. These hard lumps of tissue range in size from about the size of a pea to as large as a ping pong ball. They may develop under the skin over bony areas such as the elbow, ankle, or finger. They can also form on organs such as the lungs. For some people, treatment with \u00e2\u0080\u009c DMARDs\u00e2\u0080\u009d (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) or steroid shots may shrink nodules. You may need surgery to remove them if they get infected or become painful. It's rare, but in some people, nodules are a sign that they have rheumatoid vasculitis, which is inflammation of the small and medium-sized blood vessels. Only about 1 in 100 people with rheumatoid arthritis get vasculitis. The most commonly affected blood vessels are arteries that carry blood to the skin, nerves, and internal organs. When the small vessels of the fingertips and around the nails are affected, the result can be small pits on the fingertips or small sores or redness around the nail. If it happens in larger blood vessels, it can cause a painful rash, often on the legs. In serious cases, ulcers can form and there's a chance they could become infected. The skin problems people with RA have are often related to the medications they take to ease symptoms or control their disease. Drug-related skin problems include: Skin rashes . This can happen if you take drugs such as: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac ( Voltaren) Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil) Ibuprofen Leflunomide ( Arava) Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall) Minocycline ( Minocin) Naproxen Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Tolmetin ( Tolectin) A skin rash can be a sign of an allergic reaction to a drug. So you should let your doctor know if your skin breaks out or starts itching. Depending on the type of rash you have and how severe it is, your doctor may lower the dose or stop your medication altogether. In some cases, you may need another drug, such as a corticosteroid or antihistamine, to stop the reaction. Easy bruising. Certain arthritis medications make you more likely to bruise because they thin the skin or interfere with blood clotting. These include aspirin and steroids such as prednisone. Sun sensitivity. Drugs that can make your skin more sensitive to sun include: Cyclosporine ( Sandimmune, Neoral) Diclofenac ( Voltaren) Diflunisal ( Dolobid) Ketoprofen Methotrexate ( Rheumatrex, Trexall) Naproxen ( Naprosyn) Piroxicam ( Feldene) If you take medicines that do this, avoid direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Don't use tanning beds. When outdoors, wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more that protects against UVA and UVB rays."

There are many ways to keep those feelings under control, including relaxation methods and exercise. To help manage your emotions, it helps to learn the warning signs that you are under too much stress. Your body sends out physical, emotional, and behavioral warning signs of stress: Some of the emotional signals you may notice are that you: Get angry Find it hard to concentrate Feel worried Become sad Have frequent mood swings Physical warning signs include: Stooped posture Sweaty palms Fatigue Weight gain or loss You'll know you're starting to show behavioral warning signs when you: Overreact Act on impulse Use alcohol or drugs Withdraw from your relationships Part of your strategy to cut stress is to keep a positive attitude and accept that there are some events that you can't control. Also try to follow these tips: Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, combative, or passive. Learn relaxation techniques. Exercise regularly. Eat well-balanced meals. Get enough sleep and rest. Don't rely on alcohol or drugs to end stress. A number of methods can calm things down. Exercises include breathing, muscle and mind relaxation, and relaxation to music. Whichever you try, first make sure you have a: Quiet location that's free of distractions Comfortable body position (sit or recline on a chair or sofa) Good state of mind (try to block out worries and distracting thoughts) Then try one of these techniques: Two-minute relaxation. Switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. Take a few deep breaths, then breathe out slowly. Mentally scan your body. Notice areas that feel tense or cramped and then loosen them up. Let go of as much tension as you can. Rotate your head in a smooth, circular motion once or twice. ( Stop if you feel pain.) Roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. Let all your muscles completely relax. Recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. Take another deep breath and then breathe out slowly. Mind relaxation. Close your eyes. Breathe normally through your nose. As you breathe out, silently say to yourself the word \"one,\" a short word such as \"peaceful,\" or a short phrase such as \" I feel quiet.\" Continue for 10 minutes. If your mind wanders, gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. Let your breathing become slow and steady. Deep-breathing relaxation. Imagine a spot just below your navel. Breathe into that spot and fill your belly with air. Let the air fill you from the belly up, then let it out, like deflating a balloon. With every long, slow breath out, you should feel more relaxed."

        "context": "After a fracture, your bone needs to rebuild. A healthy, well-balanced diet rich in key nutrients can help speed that up. You don't need to take supplements unless your doctor recommends it. They don't always work well. It's much better to get the nutrition you need from your plate, not from a pill. About half your bone's structure is made of this. When you have a fracture, your body needs it to build new bone for the repair. It also helps your body take in and use calcium, another key nutrient for healthy bones. Good sources: Meat, fish, milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, nuts, seeds, beans, soy products, and fortified cereals. This mineral also helps you build strong bones, so foods and drinks rich in it can help your bone fracture heal. Adults should get between 1,000 and 1,200 milligrams of calcium each day. Your doctor will tell if you need a calcium supplement, and what amount you should take if you do. Good sources: Milk, yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, broccoli, turnip or collard greens, kale, bok choy, soy, beans, canned tuna or salmon with bones, almond milk, and fortified cereals or juice. This vitamin should be a part of your diet to help your fracture heal. It helps your blood take in and use calcium and build up the minerals in your bones. You get some vitamin D when sunlight hits your skin, so it can be a good idea to spend a short amount of time outdoors each day -- 15 minutes may be enough for a fair-skinned person. Vitamin D is found naturally in only a few foods like egg yolks and fatty fish, but manufacturers add it to other foods, like milk or orange juice. Adults should get at least 600 IU of vitamin D every day, and if you're over 70 you should get at least 800 IU. Good sources: Swordfish, salmon, cod liver oil, sardines, liver, fortified milk or yogurt, egg yolks, and fortified orange juice. Collagen is a protein that's an important building block for bone. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, which helps your bone fracture heal. You can get it from many tasty, fresh fruits and veggies. Aged or heated produce can lose some of its vitamin C, so go for fresh or frozen. Good sources: Citrus fruits like oranges, kiwi fruit, berries, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and green vegetables. If you have iron-deficiency anemia -- when you don't have enough healthy red blood cells -- you may heal more slowly after a fracture. Iron helps your body make collagen to rebuild bone. It also plays a part in getting oxygen into your bones to help them heal. Good sources: Red meat, dark-meat chicken or turkey, oily fish, eggs, dried fruits, leafy green veggies, whole-grain breads, and fortified cereals. Get enough of this mineral in your diet, and you won't lose as much calcium when you pee. There are lots of fresh fruits rich in potassium. Good sources: Bananas, orange juice, potatoes, nuts, seeds, fish, meat, and milk. It's a good idea to cut back on or skip these: Alcohol: While you don't have to cut out alcoholic drinks, these beverages slow down bone healing. You won't build new bone as fast to fix the fracture. A bit too much alcohol can also make you unsteady on your feet, which can make you more likely to fall and risk an injury to the same bone. Salt: Too much of this in your diet can make you lose more calcium in your urine. Salt can be in some foods or drinks that don't taste salty, so check labels and aim for about 1 teaspoon, or 6 grams, a day. Coffee: Lots of caffeine -- more than four cups of strong coffee a day -- can slow down bone healing a little. It might make you pee more, and that could mean you lose more calcium through your urine. A moderate amount of coffee or tea should be fine."

        "context": "Skin warts are common, and there are many treatments. If home remedies for warts don't work, you can try over-the-counter wart removers. If your warts still don't disappear, you can turn to treatment by a doctor, who can freeze or cut off the wart. Here are some home remedies and treatments for common warts, such as plantar warts on the soles of the feet or palmar warts on the hands. For the most part, these remedies do not work very often. People try countless home remedies for warts, but most do not help. They rub warts with garlic, or apply a paste made of baking powder and castor oil. They crush vitamin C tablets into a paste to cover the wart. They even soak warts in pineapple juice. Prolonged application of duct tape also has its fans, although evidence does not support its use. Most dermatologists say it's safe to try drugstore wart removers -- as long as you've confirmed that it's really a wart. Sometimes calluses or corns are mistaken for warts. If in doubt, ask your doctor. Many over-the-counter wart treatments contain salicylic acid. The success rate is about 50% over 6 weeks or so. Other treatments work by \"freezing\" the wart. After two or three treatments, each lasting about 10 days, the success rate is about 40% to 50%. There is also the option of over-the-counter freezing sprays which can kill the wart by freezing the tissue. The spray has to be applied directly to the wart area in an effort to freeze deep enough into the effected tissue. For this reason, these sprays are only really effective on smaller warts. If successful, the wart should disappear in a few days. Over-the-counter treatments aren't recommended for common warts on the face or lips and should not be used on genital warts. See your doctor about treatments for those warts. If you go to a doctor, you can choose from many wart treatments. Some focus on destroying the wart and others on boosting your immune system so your body clears the wart. Among the options: Liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart off Prescription-strength salicylic acid applied at home to get rid of the wart Laser or surgery to cut the wart off Topical immune system stimulants such as squaric acid, which is applied to the skin for several weeks to help fight the virus that causes the wart Immune therapy for warts can take 6 to 12 weeks to work. Removing warts with a laser or surgery is the fastest treatment, but is also the most expensive and invasive. It also may cause scarring."

        "context": "If you use insulin for diabetes, you still might get swings in your blood sugar levels once in a while. But what if they won't go down, even with insulin? Don't worry. It's not the only way to get your condition under control. Healthy habits and diabetes medicine can also help. Some of best ways to prevent high blood sugar are old-school: Exercise. When you do it regularly, it's like adding another medicine to your care. It makes the insulin you take work better, and it removes the sugar, or glucose, from your blood. It also helps you lose weight, which can lower blood sugar. Try to build up to at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days, even if you start with just 5 minutes. Talk to your diabetes care team first about how to work out safely. Eat right. A healthy diet keeps your blood sugar within a safe range. It's the most important way to help you shed pounds if you're overweight. Work with a registered dietitian or a certified diabetes educator to learn about the best food to eat and how to build a meal plan that works for your lifestyle. Weight loss medications are another option you can consider if you need to get thinner. Talk to your doctor about which ones might be a good choice for you. Relax. Stress blocks your body from releasing insulin, and that lets glucose pile up in your blood. If you're stressed for a long time, your sugar levels will keep building. Regular exercise and relaxation techniques -- like yoga, meditation, tai chi, and breathing exercises -- can help. If the insulin dose you take isn't enough to lower high blood sugar, your doctor may change how much you take and how you take it. For instance, he may ask you to: Increase your dose. Take a fast-acting type before meals to help with swings in blood sugar after you eat. Take a long-acting type once or twice a day to help give you smoother blood sugar control. Use an insulin pump, which may make it easier to manage your blood sugar levels. There are other possible causes of your high blood sugar, such as insulin resistance, which may run in your family. That's when your body doesn't respond as well as it should to the insulin it makes. Or, you may be taking a drug for another health problem that keeps your body from using it well. How you use insulin can also matter. If you give yourself shots in the same place over and over, for instance, that area may scar, which can affect how your body absorbs the hormone. It helps to change spots or use an insulin pump. Some people also take less insulin than they should. It might be because they're afraid of low blood sugar, or they're nervous about needles. You might feel more comfortable by slowly increasing your insulin dose. Consider an insulin pump or pen if you don't like needles. Whatever the cause of your blood sugar highs, work closely with your doctor to find a solution. And always talk with him before you make any changes in your insulin dose."

        "context": "Cancer and cancer treatments can weaken your immune system and make it hard for it to protect your body against germs. Chemotherapy, for example, can lower the number of white blood cells you have. Because their job is to stop infections, it makes it tougher for your body to fight germs. Some things that can make it easier for you to get an infection include: Chemotherapy Radiation Stress Lack of sleep Poor nutrition Cancer that affects the blood or lymph nodes, such as leukemia or lymphoma Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body But you can do a few things to protect yourself. Wash your hands. Do it often, and use soap and water. Wash them before you eat and before you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Always clean up after you go to the bathroom, sneeze, cough, or blow your nose. Other times to wash: after you handle trash, go to a public place, or touch an animal. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you in case you can't get to soap and water when you're out and about. Eat a well-balanced diet. Ask your doctor if you can eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Some doctors say it's OK as long as you wash the produce very well. Others say it's safer to just skip them. Stay away from raw meats, shellfish, and eggs. It may also be smart to avoid foods that have been linked to infection outbreaks in the past, like raw sprouts, berries, and fresh salsa. Don't eat deli foods, free food samples, or yogurt and ice cream products from soft-serve machines. Skip foods bought from self-serve or bulk bins. Don't buy dented cans or pre-cut fruits and veggies. Be careful around people. If you know that someone has a fever, cold, flu, or any other infection, stay away from them until they feel better. It's also best to skip large groups of people, so avoid shopping, schools, traveling, and crowds. If you do go out in public, use cleaning wipes before you touch door handles, elevator buttons, ATM keypads, or any other surface used by a lot of people. Take care of your body. Take a shower or bath every day. Pay special attention to your feet, armpits, and other sweaty areas. When you're done, use lotion so your skin doesn't get dry and crack. Consider using an electric shaver instead of a razor so you don't cut yourself. Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Ask if it's OK to floss gently. Don't use alcohol-based mouthwashes -- your doctor or dentist may give you a special mouthwash. Use gloves. Be careful when you garden or do housework. Wear gloves so you don't hurt your hands or pick up germs from the soil. Use caution when you handle sharp things like scissors, knives, or gardening tools. Don't share. Don't use the same glasses, utensils, or food as others. Don't share towels, toothbrushes, or makeup, either. Watch what you touch. Try not to change diapers. If you do, wash your hands as soon as possible when you're done. Don't clean up after your pet in the yard, and don't touch dirt that could have animal droppings in it. Let someone else change the litter boxes, clean the birdcage, or clean the fish or turtle tanks."

        "context": "Come on, admit it. You've suffered from bad breath. Everyone has. It's one of life's most common annoyances. The good news is we can do something about it. But first, you need to know where it comes from. Bad breath starts with what you put in your mouth. Garlic for lunch? A late-morning latte? They may taste delicious, but consider yourself warned. Food you eat: Although garlic and coffee are two main offenders, other eats like onions and spicy food also can bring on bad breath. The odors of these foods enter your bloodstream and head right to your lungs, coming out with each exhale. Food \"trapped\" in your mouth: We're not talking about just a little spinach on your teeth. After a meal, any food particles that remain between your teeth, in your gums, or on your tongue can release their odor into your breath -- which gets worse as that food decays. And without good care of your teeth and gums, this stuck food can set off a cascade of events leading to gum disease. Tobacco: There are lots of reasons to avoid tobacco; bad breath is one on the list. Diets that lead to weight loss: We agree that it seems unjust, but when your body breaks down fat, the process releases chemicals that can give your breath an unpleasant smell. Dry mouth: Feeling parched? Saliva's job is to serve as a continuous rinse cycle for your mouth. If you don't have enough, your mouth loses its freshness fast. In fact, morning breath is worse for people who sleep with their mouths open. A dry mouth is a smelly mouth. Medications or health issues: Drugs that cause dry mouth can also contribute to bad breath. Health problems such as seasonal allergies, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, respiratory infections, stomach problems, diabetes, and liver and kidney diseases factor in, too. Unrelenting bad breath may also be a sign of gum disease. There are some quick and easy ways to banish bad breath. Just remember, the odor from what you eat can stick around until the food works its way completely out of your system -- up to 3 days later! Clean those teeth: Not only do they prevent odor-causing plaque from building up in your mouth, but brushing, flossing and rinsing are healthy for your gums and teeth, too. If you can't brush after a meal, give your mouth a good rinse with water to at least loosen up and free those trapped bits. Clean that tongue: Bacteria on your tongue can contribute to bad breath. When you brush your teeth, brush your tongue, too, or use a tongue scraper. Use a mouthwash or dental rinse. Antiseptic mouthwash can help kill bacteria that cause bad breath and plaque that can lead to gingivitis, an early, mild form of gum disease. Adding a fluoride rinse to your daily routine can help prevent tooth decay. Drink water: If your bad breath is caused by weight loss, water can dilute the chemicals that cause the odors. Water also helps wash away bacteria and food particles. Eat breakfast: Even if you brush your teeth when you get up, your morning breath may reappear if you don't eat. Morning mouth may be associated with hunger. Eat a hard fruit or vegetable: Apples, carrots, celery, and other hard fruits and vegetables help clear odor-causing plaque and food particles from your mouth. Chew sugarless gum with xylitol: Gum with the natural sweetener xylitol can prevent the growth of bad-breath bacteria. The gum itself can bring more saliva to your mouth, which will naturally make your mouth fresher. Take care of health problems: Work with your doctor to keep diabetes, allergies, and other conditions under control."

There are several classes of non-insulin medicines to choose from that hit type 2 diabetes in different ways. Because these drugs can work together, your doctor may prescribe you more than one. These can include: Metformin, which works in your liver Thiazolidinediones (or glitazones), which improve sugar removal from your blood Secretagogues, which help your pancreas make more insulin Starch blockers, which slow down how your body absorbs sugar from the food you eat Incretin-based therapies, which help your liver make less sugar. They also slow how you absorb food. They can be pills or shots. You might also take one pill that mixes two types of medicine. That's known as combination therapy. You inject some non-insulin drugs rather than swallowing them. These drugs fall in one of two types: GLP-1 receptor agonists: These help your body make insulin. They also help your liver make less glucose. There are several types you can talk with your doctor about. You inject some every day, and you get others once a week. Amylin analog: This type slows your digestion. That keeps your glucose level down and helps your liver leave the numbers low. You inject these before meals. You may not have to take insulin if you have type 2 diabetes, but sometimes it's needed. What type of insulin you would take depends on what's going on with you. The main groups are: Fast-acting insulin: It goes into your system within 30 minutes and works best to control blood sugar during meals and snacks. There's also \"rapid-acting\" insulin that starts to work in about half the time, but doesn't work as long. Intermediate-acting insulin: It takes longer for your body to absorb than the fast-acting kind, but it lasts longer. It's good at controlling your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Long-lasting insulin: This type can make your glucose level stable for most of the day. It works overnight, between meals, and when you're fasting. In some cases, it can work even longer than 24 hours. There are also mixtures of insulin that combine long-lasting and fast-acting. These are sometimes called combination insulin. Talk to your doctor to figure out which type is best for you. You and your doctor also need to choose which way to get insulin may work best for you. Your insurance coverage might play a role, too. Here are some choices: Syringe: You'd use this to give yourself insulin shots. You may put them in your: Belly Thigh Buttocks Upper arm Pen: These have a needle at the tip. The idea is the same as a syringe, but you may find it easier to use. Pump: This is a machine that you carry in a small pocket or pouch on your belt. It's connected by a thin tube to a needle that goes into your skin. You get a steady dose of insulin. Bariatric surgery, which you may know as gastric bypass, isn't specifically a treatment for type 2 diabetes. But if your doctor says your body mass index ( BMI) is higher than 35, you may want to consider this weight loss surgery. It's important to note that long-term effects from it on type 2 diabetes are unknown. Talk to your doctor if you're considering it. Researchers are still studying the effects, but some people who had the surgery lost a significant amount of weight and saw their blood sugar get back to normal. The idea behind this is to develop a single system that will watch your blood glucose level 24/7 and give you insulin or other drugs automatically when you need them. A type called the hybrid closed loop system won approval from the FDA in 2016. It tests your glucose level every 5 minutes and gives you insulin when you need it. Artificial pancreas research has focused mostly on people with type 1 diabetes. It may help people with type 2 as well."
